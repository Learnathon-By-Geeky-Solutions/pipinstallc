## Project Description
EduSphere is envisioned as a dynamic online platform designed to enhance the university learning experience through personalized learning pathways, academic collaboration, and resource sharing. Addressing the challenges of traditional learning environments, EduSphere will empower university students to learn at their own pace, access relevant academic resources, and connect with peers for collaborative learning. 

This platform will foster an academic community where students can seamlessly transition between the roles of learner and teacher. By providing tools for personalized teaching and mentorship, EduSphere aims to improve student outcomes, build a strong sense of community, and create a more supportive and effective learning ecosystem for university students.

## Key Highlights
- **Academic Resource Hub:** Centralized repository for sharing study materials, notes, and other academic resources. 

- **Peer-to-Peer Collaboration:** Features to facilitate group projects, study groups, and knowledge exchange. 

- **Personalized Teaching Opportunities:** Students can share their expertise and provide guidance to others. 

- **Community Building:** Fostering a strong and supportive academic network among university students.

## Stakeholders
- **Student:** University students are the primary users and the core beneficiary group of the EduSphere platform. They will utilize EduSphere to enhance their learning experience, access academic resources, collaborate with peers, and potentially share their own knowledge. Students will play the role of both learner and teacher within the system

- **Admin:** Administrators are responsible for the overall management, operation, and maintenance of the EduSphere platform. This group ensures the platform functions smoothly, remains secure, and meets the needs of its users. Administrators oversee the technical and operational aspects of EduSphere.
